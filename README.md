## What is Kubernetes? :ship:

> Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of "labels" and "pods", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

_Source:_ [What is Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)


## History:

**Kubernetes is known to be a descendant of Google's system BORG**

> The first unified container-management system developed at Google was the system we internally call Borg.
It was built to manage both long-running services and batch jobs, which had previously been handled by two separate
systems: Babysitter and the Global Work Queue. The latter’s architecture strongly influenced Borg, but was focused on
batch jobs; both predated Linux control groups.

_Source:_ [Kubernetes Past](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44843.pdf)


## Roadmap

The awesome-kubernetes will now soon be available in the form of different releases and package bundles, It means that you can
download the awesome kubernetes release upto a certain period of time, The release for awesome kubernetes 2015 bundle is released.Checkout the releases column for more info.Stay tuned for more updates.

## Related Software

*Projects built to make life with Kubernetes even better, more powerful, more scalable*


### [Hypernetes](https://github.com/hyperhq/hypernetes)

Hypernetes is a secure, multi-tenant Kubernetes distro. Simply put,

Hypernetes = Bare-metal + Hyper + Kubernetes + KeyStone + Cinder + Neutron.

It envisions a future of "Container-as-a-Service without IaaS". The idea is to combine the orchestration power in Kubernetes and the runtime isolation in Hyper to build the truly secure multi-tenant CaaS platform.


### [Helm Package Manager](https://deis.com/blog/2015/introducing-helm-for-kubernetes)

Built by Deis and Inspired by Homebrew, apt, and NPM. Helm is a tool for working with Kubernetes-powered applications. Helm makes it easy run apps and services inside Kubernetes.


### [Ubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/proposals/federation.md)

A central design concept in Kubernetes to cluster Kubernetes across several regions.


### [Minikube](http://github.com/kubernetes/minikube/)

Minikube is a tool that makes it easy to run Kubernetes locally. Minikube runs a single-node Kubernetes cluster inside a VM on your laptop for users looking to try out Kubernetes or develop with it day-to-day.


### [kmachine](https://github.com/skippbox/kmachine)

kmachine lets you create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them just like docker-machine


### [spread](https://github.com/redspread/spread)

spread is a command line tool that builds and deploys a Docker project to a Kubernetes cluster in one command. The project's goals are to:

- Enable rapid iteration with Kubernetes
- Be the fastest, simplest way to deploy Docker to production
- Work well for a single developer or an entire team (no more broken bash scripts!)


### [Supergiant](https://supergiant.io)

Supergiant is open-source and built on Kubernetes. It provisions "cost-based" server resources, load balancers, and block-level storage automatically to support stateful apps at scale with less hardware expense. The goals of the project are to make launching, managing, and scaling Kubernetes as easy as possible.

### [Kubefuse](https://opencredo.com/introducing-kubefuse-file-system-kubernetes/)

Kubernetes as a Filesystem.Its written in Python, because Python is still cool and has a solid FUSE library available for it. The fusepy library has some simple examples showing how to implement loopback and memory file systems.


## Monitoring Services

*To maintain regular surveillance over kubernetes*

* [Console](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard):
  It is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows to manage applications running in the cluster, troubleshoot them, as well as, manage the cluster itself.
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/):
  Datadog is a hosted monitoring and metrics platform, with built in support for Kubernetes and Docker.  Their Kubernetes integration pulls in Docker and Kubernetes events, converts labels and pod names into tags, as well as pulls metrics from Docker and CAdvisor.  This allows you to build application dashboards and alerts that display data across pods, Nodes, and services.
* [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster):
  Heapster enables Container Cluster Monitoring and Performance Analysis.
  Heapster currently supports Kubernetes and CoreOS natively. It can be extended to support other cluster management solutions easily. Heapster collects and interprets various signals like compute resource usage, lifecycle events, etc, and exports cluster metrics via REST endpoints.
* [Kubedash](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubedash):
  Performance analytics UI for Kubernetes Clusters.
  The goal of Kubedash is to allow the user or an administrator of a Kubernetes cluster to easily verify and understand the performance of a cluster and jobs running within it through intuitive visualizations of aggregated metrics, derived stats and event patterns. It is not intended to be a general-purpose Kubernetes UI. Instead, kubedash uses multiple sources of information to summarize and provide high-level analytic information to users and to the cluster administrator.
* [Kube-ui](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-ui):
  Container Cluster Manager from Google Web UI
* [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io):
  Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company.
* [Sysdig](http://www.sysdig.org/):
  Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration: capture system state and activity from a running Linux instance, then save,  filter and analyze. Sysdig is scriptable in Lua and includes a command line interface and a powerful interactive UI, csysdig, that runs in your terminal.
* [Weave Scope](https://www.weave.works/products/weave-scope/):
  Weave Scope is a visualization, and monitoring tool for Docker and Kubernetes. It provides a top down view into your app as well as your entire infrastructure, and allows you to diagnose any problems with your distributed containerized app, in real time, as it being deployed to a cloud provider.


## PaaS Providers

*Kubernetes Platform as a Service providers*


### [OpenShift](https://www.openshift.com/)

OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows developers to quickly develop, host, and scale applications in a cloud environment. With OpenShift you have a choice of offerings, including online, on premise, and open source project options.


### [Deis](http://deis.io/)

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon Docker and CoreOS to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.


## Continous Delivery

*Build-test-deploy automated workflow software designed to make production environments more stable and life better for engineers*


### [Fabric8](http://fabric8.io)

Fabric8 DevOps provides a completely integrated open source DevOps platform which works out of the box on any Kubernetes or OpenShift environment, The entire platform is modular and based on microservices so you can use as much or as little of Fabric8 DevOps as you wish!

Container Support
=======================================================================

*A list of linux containers supported by kubernetes.*

### [Docker](http://docker.com):

Docker is an open platform for developers and sysadmins to build, ship, and run distributed applications. Consisting of Docker Engine, a portable, lightweight runtime and packaging tool, and Docker Hub, a cloud service for sharing applications and automating workflows, Docker enables apps to be quickly assembled from components and eliminates the friction between development, QA, and production environments. As a result, IT can ship faster and run the same app, unchanged, on laptops, data center VMs, and any cloud.Check out [awesome-docker](https://github.com/veggiemonk/awesome-docker/) for more info.

### [Rkt](http://coreos.com/rkt):

rkt is the next-generation container manager for Linux clusters. Designed for security, simplicity, and composability within modern cluster architectures, rkt discovers, verifies, fetches, and executes application containers with pluggable isolation. rkt can run the same container with varying degrees of protection, from lightweight, OS-level namespace and capabilities isolation to heavier, VM-level hardware virtualization.
