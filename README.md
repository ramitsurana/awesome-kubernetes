# What is Kubernetes ? :ship:

> Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of "labels" and "pods", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

## Main Resources:

## Monitoring:
*To maintain regular surveillance over kubernetes*

* [Console](https://github.com/kubernetes/dashboard):
  It is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows to manage applications running in the cluster, troubleshoot them, as well as, manage the cluster itself.
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/):
 Datadog is a hosted monitoring and metrics platform, with built in support for Kubernetes and Docker.  Their Kubernetes integration pulls in Docker and Kubernetes events, converts labels and pod names into tags, as well as pulls metrics from Docker and CAdvisor.  This allows you to build application dashboards and alerts that display data across pods, Nodes, and services.
* [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster): 
Heapster enables Container Cluster Monitoring and Performance Analysis.
Heapster currently supports Kubernetes and CoreOS natively. It can be extended to support other cluster management solutions easily. Heapster collects and interprets various signals like compute resource usage, lifecycle events, etc, and exports cluster metrics via REST endpoints.
* [Kubedash](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubedash):
Performance analytics UI for Kubernetes Clusters.
The goal of Kubedash is to allow the user or an administrator of a Kubernetes cluster to easily verify and understand the performance of a cluster and jobs running within it through intuitive visualizations of aggregated metrics, derived stats and event patterns. It is not intended to be a general-purpose Kubernetes UI. Instead, kubedash uses multiple sources of information to summarize and provide high-level analytic information to users and to the cluster administrator.
* [Kube-ui](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-ui):
 Container Cluster Manager from Google Web UI 
* [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io):
 Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud. Since its inception in 2012, many companies and organizations have adopted Prometheus, and the project has a very active developer and user community. It is now a standalone open source project and maintained independently of any company.
* [Sysdig](http://www.sysdig.org/):
 Sysdig is open source, system-level exploration: capture system state and activity from a running Linux instance, then save,  filter and analyze. Sysdig is scriptable in Lua and includes a command line interface and a powerful interactive UI,csysdig, that runs in your terminal.

## Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Engine:
Hyper is a Hypervisor-agnostic Docker Engine that allows you to run Docker images on any hypervisor (KVM, Xen, etc.).
Technically speaking,

Hyper = Hypervisor + Kernel + Docker Image

By containing applications within separate VM instances and kernel spaces, Hyper is able to offer an excellent Hardware-enforced Isolation, which is much needed in multi-tenant environments.

Hyper also promises Immutable Infrastructure by eliminating the middle layer of Guest OS, along with the hassle to configure and manage them.

## Helm Package manager:
Built by Deis and Inspired by Homebrew, apt, and npm, Helm is a tool for working with Kubernetes-powered applications.Helm makes it easy run apps and services inside Kubernetes.

* [Introducing Helm, The Kubernetes Package Manager](https://deis.com/blog/2015/introducing-helm-for-kubernetes)

## Ubernetes:

A central design concept in Kubernetes to cluster Kubernetes across several regions.

* [Introducing Kubernetes Cluster Federation a.k.a Ubernetes](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes/blob/master/docs/proposals/federation.md)
 
## [Fabric8](http://fabric8.io/):

An integrated open source DevOps and Integration Platform which works out of the box on any Kubernetes or OpenShift environment and provides Continuous Delivery, Management, ChatOps and a Chaos Monkey.

## [Kmachine](https://github.com/skippbox/kmachine):

kmachine lets you create Docker hosts on your computer, on cloud providers, and inside your own data center. It creates servers, installs Docker on them, then configures the Docker client to talk to them just like docker-machine

## [spread](https://github.com/redspread/spread):

spread is a command line tool that builds and deploys a Docker project to a Kubernetes cluster in one command. The project's goals are to:

- Enable rapid iteration with Kubernetes
- Be the fastest, simplest way to deploy Docker to production
- Work well for a single developer or an entire team (no more broken bash scripts!)

## [noel](https://github.com/jonparrott/noel):

Noel is an example Platform-as-a-Service-like workflow built on top of Kubernetes.

##PaaS Providers:

### [Openshift](https://www.openshift.com/):

OpenShift is Red Hat's Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) that allows developers to quickly develop, host, and scale applications in a cloud environment. With OpenShift you have a choice of offerings, including online, on premise, and open source project options.

###[Deis](http://deis.io/):

Deis (pronounced DAY-iss) is an open source PaaS that makes it easy to deploy and manage applications on your own servers. Deis builds upon Docker and CoreOS to provide a lightweight PaaS with a Heroku-inspired workflow.

## Continous Delivery:

###[Fabric8](http://fabric8.io):

Fabric8 DevOps provides a completely integrated open source DevOps platform which works out of the box on any Kubernetes or OpenShift environment.The entire platform is modular and based on microservices so you can use as much or as little of Fabric8 DevOps as you wish!
