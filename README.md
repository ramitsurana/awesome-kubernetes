## What is Kubernetes? :ship:

> Kubernetes is an open source orchestration system for Docker containers. It handles scheduling onto nodes in a compute cluster and actively manages workloads to ensure that their state matches the users declared intentions. Using the concepts of "labels" and "pods", it groups the containers which make up an application into logical units for easy management and discovery.

_Source:_ [What is Kubernetes](http://kubernetes.io/)


## History:

**Kubernetes is known to be a descendant of Google's system BORG**

> The first unified container-management system developed at Google was the system we internally call Borg.
It was built to manage both long-running services and batch jobs, which had previously been handled by two separate
systems: Babysitter and the Global Work Queue. The latter’s architecture strongly influenced Borg, but was focused on
batch jobs; both predated Linux control groups.

_Source:_ [Kubernetes Past](http://research.google.com/pubs/archive/44843.pdf)

## Date of Birth:

Kubernetes celebrates its birthday every year on 21st July.The project was born in the year 2015.

## Roadmap

The awesome-kubernetes will now soon be available in the form of different releases and package bundles, It means that you can
download the awesome kubernetes release up to a certain period of time, The release for awesome kubernetes 2015 bundle is released.Checkout the releases column for more info.Stay tuned for more updates.

  It is a general purpose, web-based UI for Kubernetes clusters. It allows to manage applications running in the cluster, troubleshoot them, as well as, manage the cluster itself.
* [Datadog](https://www.datadoghq.com/):
  Datadog is a hosted monitoring and metrics platform, with built in support for Kubernetes and Docker.  Their Kubernetes integration pulls in Docker and Kubernetes events, converts labels and pod names into tags, as well as pulls metrics from Docker and CAdvisor.  This allows you to build application dashboards and alerts that display data across pods, Nodes, and services.
* [Heapster](https://github.com/kubernetes/heapster):
  Heapster enables Container Cluster Monitoring and Performance Analysis.
  Heapster currently supports Kubernetes and CoreOS natively. It can be extended to support other cluster management solutions easily. Heapster collects and interprets various signals like compute resource usage, lifecycle events, etc, and exports cluster metrics via REST endpoints.
* [Kubedash](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubedash):
  Performance analytics UI for Kubernetes Clusters.
  The goal of Kubedash is to allow the user or an administrator of a Kubernetes cluster to easily verify and understand the performance of a cluster and jobs running within it through intuitive visualizations of aggregated metrics, derived stats and event patterns. It is not intended to be a general-purpose Kubernetes UI. Instead, kubedash uses multiple sources of information to summarize and provide high-level analytic information to users and to the cluster administrator.
* [Kube-ui](https://github.com/kubernetes/kube-ui):
  Container Cluster Manager from Google Web UI
* [Prometheus](http://prometheus.io):
  Prometheus is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at SoundCloud.
